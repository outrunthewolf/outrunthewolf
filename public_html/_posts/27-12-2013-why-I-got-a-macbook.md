title: Why I bought a MacBook
---

Just after Christmas I made the switch from developing on Linux (Elementary) an Ubuntu derivative to developing on the Mac, a MacBook Air to be exact.

It was kind of a massive move for me, i'd spent the last 6 years developing on linux in its various forms, but the death of my laptop gave me a chance to make a change.

I'd been recommended the Macbook Air and after sizing it up against the Pro and various windows laptops, I went for it.

### Dispensing myths
Theres still a rift in developers on price vs power when it comes to a mac, with the majority of serious developers still see the mac as a designers mainstay.
It is true that for the price of a new apple product, you can get a very powerful windows based PC, it is also true that you can lose windows for a Linux distribution incredibly easily.

### Drawbacks
Price can be an issue, your average laptop can set ypu back around &pound;350 and you can flash that with a linux distro for free. A mac laptop comes in closer to and above &pound;1000. The actual hardware (processor, ram, etc...) for the price is not as high end as a simliarly priced windows machine.
No Linux means no aptitute, or yum or whatever your using, it also means no Linux kernel so things like Docker do not run natively.
If your moving from Linux you're commands are different, and getting used to desktop flow is a little tricky at first.

### Positives
The mac offers a full solution, the operating system has all the benefits of Linux with the plus points of a beautiful interface.
The build quality is amazing, like truly fantastic. The keys are backlit, its not flimsy, it feels solid. 
And hell, its a mac!

### Conclusion
Although price is still an issue for me (I tend to not dwell on how much I spent). I could never go back to any other laptop. The battery lasts all day and some, I can carry the thing around with me forever and its half the weight of my old laptop. I've already corrupted the hard drive twice, and the restore from the cloud feature is a great, coupled with boxen its a life-saver. The gestures on the trackpad, copied poorly by my old samsung laptop are really helpful and intuitive.
And so on.

So overall I dont advocate everyone get a mac, but if you use your laptop constantly, and find you want a reliable and sturdy device, something that you're going to use for some time to come, and want all the benefits of a unix system... Check out a MacBook.
