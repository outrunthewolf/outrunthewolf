title: Don't Skimp
---

Before I start, this post is definately about development... just bear with me :)

Single handedly one of the most frustrating, endless, annoying, back-breaking thing I've ever done is... Own a house. When someone coined the term "fixer-upper" they must have been staring at this beast.

I've learned a shit load of things I never knew before from doing this house up. Theres the general life lessons like, builders are always late, nothing is ever finished on time, everything takes 3 times longer than you think, etc... learned some pretty handy skills, how to tank a wetroom, plaster, lay electric cables, put in lintels. But if there is one lesson i've been taught that has made a massive difference on my life it is, "Don't Skimp", on anything.

By "skimp" I mean don't buy the cheapest thing just because it's cheap. Yes save money where you can, optimise, be more efficient, do things yourself, but don't save money for the sake of it, it's a false economy.
