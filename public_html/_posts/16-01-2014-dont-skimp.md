title: Don't Skimp
---

Single handedly one of the most frustrating, endless, annoying, back-breaking things I've ever done is... Own a house.
When someone coined the term "fixer-upper" they must have been staring at this beast.

Its been about three years now since we've been moved in, and undergoing the restoration you could call it. I reckon we're about 85% done.

I've learned a shit load of things I never knew before from doing this house up. Theres the general life lessons like, builders are always very late, or very early, nothing is ever finished on time, everything takes 3 times longer than you think, etc... learned some pretty handy skills, how to tank a wetroom, plaster, lay electric cables, put in lintels. But if there is one lesson i've been taught that has made a massive difference on my life it is, "Don't Skimp".

The sheer amount of times i've "skimped" on something and paid the price later is un-believable.
